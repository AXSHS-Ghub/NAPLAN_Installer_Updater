# 📝 NAPLAN Installer & Updater

This repository provides a cross-platform solution for **installing, updating, and managing** the **NAPLAN Locked-Down Browser (LDB)** on both **Windows** and **MacOS**.

## 🌐 Overview
- ✅ **Automates installation, updating, and uninstallation** of NAPLAN LDB.
- ⏳ **Scheduled task runs daily** but intelligently adjusts update frequency.
  - ♻️ **Weekly updates** from **January to April** (preparation & testing period).
  - 🌞 **Monthly updates** outside of testing windows.
- 🔍 Automatically obtains official **NAPLAN test dates** from **ACARA**:  
  [NAPLAN Key Dates](https://www.nap.edu.au/naplan/key-dates) (please dont change the format!)
- ✈ Installs **directly from ACARA's website**:  
  [Assessform NAPLAN Online](https://www.assessform.edu.au/naplan-online/locked-down-browser)
- 📅 **Supports forced reinstalls** (for scenarios where the version hasn’t changed but has been updated).
- 🔧 **Logs locally for only troubleshooting**:
  - **MacOS**: `/var/log/naplan_update.log`
  - **Windows**: `C:\Windows\Temp\NaplanScheduledTask.log`
- **No third party data trasmission, logging(other than locally), or server reliance. (aside from this repo)**
  - Can be edited to run locally with SMB backup.
